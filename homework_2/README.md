You can run Homework2.ipynb each code blocks sequentially on Google Colab.

There are some parameters you can change for simulation:

nv: number of nodes

P: external force

dt: sampling time

RodLength: rod length

d: the distance from the origin for the rod to where the external force is

R_outer, R_inner: outer and inner radius of the rod

Y: Young's modulus
