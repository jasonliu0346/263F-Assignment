You can run Homework1.ipynb each code blocks sequentially on Google Colab.
There are some parameters you can change for simulation:
method='Explicit' : solved by explicit Eular
method='Implicit' : solved by implicit Eular
method='Newmark' : solved by Newmark-beta
dt : sampling time
maxTime : final time for simulation

Note: Remeber to run the initialization block (t=0) each time to initialize all states.
